## WELCOME
Thank you for your interest in my project

**I needed to use html, css, javascript to write this project

#The project is written in TypeScript, a React component

# With this project, it is possible to search for existing GitHub users and view their information (of course, this project is a prototype). Currently there are 4 fictitious users in the json file: 1. Octocat 2. GIOT-C 3. dogstreet 4. excess. The project also has light and dark modes.. Try and test it. 

users should be able to:
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes

##Expected behaviour

-During the first boot, only the search input is visible
-Display an error message  if no user is found when a  search is made.
-If a GitHub user's bio is empty, show the text "This profile has no bio". 
-If any of the location, website, twitter, or company properties are empty, show the text "Not Available".
